# Jetpack Compose ECG Viewer

# Introduction

I tried to add the previously created __Compose ECG widget__ inside the standard __card__ widget, adding to the latter minimal controls for the rendering procedure: start/stop and changing the rendering mode.

The application has acquired a slightly more decent appearance and similarity to applications in Java (https://github.com/mk590901/java_graph_widget_viewer) and Kotlin (https://github.com/mk590901/Kotlin-ECG-Widget-Viewer). You can see this below.
